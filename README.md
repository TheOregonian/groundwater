Shapefiles and spreadsheets used for the analysis in The Oregonian/OregonLive series, "Draining Oregon." You will find three types of files in this repository: 

PDFs -- describing analytical procedures

Spreadsheets -- containing formulas illustrating calculations directly

ESRI shapefiles -- GIS mapping files with polygons for groundwater rights.

Read the full series at oregonlive.com, where we described the methodology more broadly.
